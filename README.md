# Class-participation-10-weeks
This repository has all the details of my work that has been done in 10 weeks.

The Employee Training and Duties Data Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of training patterns and duty performance within a university context. Over 10 weeks, extensive data processing and analysis were performed using AWS cloud services to uncover trends, address data quality issues, and generate actionable insights for improving training programs and optimizing resource allocation.

By leveraging Descriptive Analysis and elements of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project identifies critical patterns, such as training hours across departments and their impact on duty completion rates. The analysis not only highlights existing inefficiencies but also lays the groundwork for data-driven decision-making to enhance employee effectiveness.

Descriptive Analysis: This type of analysis summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset in a structured and straightforward way.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA investigates datasets to find underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Itâ€™s more interactive and focuses on uncovering deeper insights.

Breakdown of the components of Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis based on my classwork:

1. Data Ingestion

I began by uploading the raw employee data to AWS S3. This ensured centralized storage and easy access for further processing. I organized the data into two distinct buckets:

**Raw Data Bucket:** Contained the unprocessed employee data.

**Transformed Data Bucket:** Used for storing the cleaned and processed data.

This step set the foundation for efficient data handling throughout the project.

**2. Data Profiling**
